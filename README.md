SVM accuracy: 97.33% 
K Means accuracy: 88.66%
C50 accuracy: 91.1%


SVM:
	Create and run a Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm that uses a hyperplane to classify the iris data into different classes. The model is trained on iris flower, specifically using the petal length and petal width. The model predicts and creates a confusion model based on the predictions. Then the misclassification rate is given.
	

K Means:
	Preprocess the data by removing the class attribute “species”, then normalize the attributes to be between 0 and 1. Create k groups from a set of objects so that the members of a group are more similar. Give the center cluster a value of 3 and give the cluster vector showing the cluster where each record falls. Next we verify the results of the clustering. Finally, we print the results of the classification

C50:
	Divide the iris data into training and testing data. Then the data is split based on the different species. Then split the data sequentially. Create a decision tree model based on the training data. Predict based on the test data and print the results.
